# DataProSurvey_ETL_Visualization
This Power BI project provides a comprehensive breakdown of the Data Professional Survey, meticulously crafted through two key steps:

1. **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load):** Utilizing Power Query, the data undergoes transformation, including the removal of empty columns and standardization of specific columns to ensure data consistency and integrity.

2. **Visualization on Dashboard:** Following the ETL process, the transformed data is visualized on an interactive dashboard, offering insightful representations of survey insights. Explore and analyze the survey data effortlessly through intuitive visualizations.
